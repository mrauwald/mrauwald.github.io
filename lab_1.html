<p> A shiny stainless steel sculpture created by 
<font color="red">Jeff Koons</font> in 1986, 
inspired by a child’s inflatable toy, sold at Christie’s on Wednesday 
night for $91.1 million with fees, breaking the record at auction for 
a work by a living artist, set just last November by <font color="red">David Hockney</font>.
Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary 
Steven Mnuchin, made the winning bid for Mr. Koons’s 1986 “Rabbit” from 
an aisle seat near the front of the salesroom. He was seated near Peter 
Brant, the collector and private museum-owner, and Jeffrey Deitch, the dealer.
