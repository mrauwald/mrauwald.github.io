		<h1>Fixed Position</h1>
		<p class="example">White, North Carolina’s all-time leading scorer for high school basketball, hit the scene running during his one year at UNC. There’s an extra emphasis on running, too. The jet-quick White pushed the pace for one of the five fastest offenses in college basketball; he ended the season with averages of 16.1 points, 4.1 assists (5.7 per 40 minutes) and 1.1 steals per game.</p>
		<p>At 6-foot-5 White proved to be a menace in North Carolina’s secondary break — constantly forcing the action. However, in the half court, White was a nice blend of volume and efficiency. For the season, White shot 35.2 percent on 3-points attempts (82 total 3-pointers); according to Synergy Sports, though, White shot 45 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-balls. These are monster numbers.</p>
		<p>Of course, White isn’t just a shooter. Early on, he showcased the ability to split ball screens with ease and attack the basket. This along with his ability to generate his own shot — basically whenever he pleases — make White an appealing NBA prospect, especially as the game gets faster and more 3-point-oriented.</p>
