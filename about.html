            <p> 
                My name is Marisa Rauwald and I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

                I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in broadcast & electronic journalism and media & technology studies & production.

                When I was younger, I used to make music videos for fun. I would make my friends dress up and act in character while I shot, edited, and directed. 

                I guess you could say I got pretty into it. At the time, I never really thought too much about this interest; <i> who wouldn't want to make music videos with their friends?</i>

                Looking back, I realize that the enjoyment I received from making these videos was unparalleled. Through my various video production experiences

                in college, my hobby of making music videos has turned into a passion for videography.
