<h2> San Francisco</h2>

<font color="white">
  San Francisco, in northern California, is a hilly city on the tip of a peninsula surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. It's known for its year-round fog, iconic Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars and colorful Victorian houses. The Financial District's Transamerica Pyramid is its most distinctive skyscraper. In the bay sits Alcatraz Island, site of the notorious former prison. </p>
  If you're going to San Francisco
  Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
  If you're going to San Francisco
  You're gonna meet some gentle people there
  For those who come to San Francisco
  Summertime will be a love-in there
  In the streets of San Francisco
  Gentle people with flowers in their hair

  People in motion

  With a new explanation

  If you come to San Francisco
  Summertime will be a love-in there

  A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle, such as a body of water, valley, or road, without closing the way underneath. It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

    The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay <br> and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California – the northern tip of the <br> San Francisco Peninsula – to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. <br> The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. <br>  It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[7]
