<p style="color:white"> POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. — One lifeguard 
    will sit perched on a tall wooden chair. Two others, maintaining distance, will 
    stand sentinel on the beach below. <br> <br> All three will wear scarflike masks and 
    carry face shields and respirators equipped with new HEPA filters. <br> <br>
They will patrol a beach that a town engineer determined can hold precisely 197 
groups in zones roughly 18-feet square, allowing six feet of space in between. <br> <br>
“We’re trying to make sure that we can safely open as much as possible, as quickly 
as possible,” said Paul M. Kanitra, the mayor of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., about 
70 miles south of New York City. “And that we don’t misstep too early.”
